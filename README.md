image_recog_nn

Using a pre-trained Deep Neural Network Inception (v. 3) for classifying images.

Replacing the last layer of Inception with transfer values and another neural network, which form a Transfer Learning, and then, performed image classification to solve what Inception fails to do in recognition.

Using the Knifey-Spoony dataset, performed video data recognition using the Transfer Learning model.

Evaluated all the performances using confusion matrix and achieved the more accurate classification results than standard models.
